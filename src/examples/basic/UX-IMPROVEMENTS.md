- Mobile-first approach
- Tested on all viewport sizes

### ‚úÖ 2. Non-Technical Language

**Before**:
```
"üéØ Test 1: Wallet Connection (useAccount)"
"Tests: connector.connect(), connector.getAccount()"
"Expected: Should auto-connect via URL params"
```

**After**:
```
"Your Wallet"
"Address: 0x1234...5678"
"Network: Base"
"Balance: 0.5 ETH"
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Visual Polish

**Before**: Basic gray cards, minimal styling
**After**:
- Beautiful gradient background (purple/blue)
- Card-based layout with shadows
- Color-coded status boxes (success = green, error = red)

### ‚úÖ 5. Better User Feedback

**Before**: Technical status messages

- "‚ùå Transaction failed - [clear error message]"
- Collapsible "View signature" details
- Context-aware tips (e.g., "With Unicorn wallet, you won't pay any gas fees!")

## Confirmation Dialog Screenshots

### Location
Confirmation dialogs appear in different ways depending on wallet:

**Unicorn Wallet**:
- Modal overlay on current page
- Embedded iframe from Thirdweb
- Shows transaction details
- "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
- Displays "Gasless transaction" badge

**MetaMask / Other Wallets**:
- Browser extension popup window
- Native wallet UI
- Shows gas fee estimate
- "Confirm" and "Reject" buttons

### What UX Team Should Look For:

1. **Clarity**: Is it clear what action is being requested?
2. **Trust**: Does it feel secure and professional?
3. **Details**: Can users see what they're approving?
4. **Branding**: Where would company branding fit?
5. **Mobile**: Does it work well on small screens?

## Next Steps for Your UX Team

### Testing Checklist:

**Desktop Testing**:
- [ ] Connect wallet and review connection flow
