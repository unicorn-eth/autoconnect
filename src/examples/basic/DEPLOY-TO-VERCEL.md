## Testing the Deployed App

### Desktop Testing
1. Open the Vercel URL in Chrome
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Connect MetaMask or use Unicorn URL params
4. Test "Send Money" - watch for confirmation dialog
5. Test "Sign a Message" - watch for signature dialog

### Mobile Testing
1. Open Vercel URL on your phone
2. Check if layout adapts properly
3. Connect wallet (should work smoothly)
4. Send a transaction - note how confirmation looks
5. Test both portrait and landscape

### Confirmation Dialog Testing

**To trigger Unicorn wallet confirmation**:
Add URL params: `?walletId=inApp&authCookie=YOUR_AUTH_COOKIE`

**What to look for**:
- Does the dialog fit the viewport?
- Is text readable on mobile?
- Are buttons easily tappable?
- Does "gasless" messaging make sense?

## Sharing with UX Team

### Email Template

```
Hi [UX Team],

I've deployed the Unicorn Wallet demo for your review:

üîó Demo URL: https://[your-app].vercel.app

Please review these aspects:
1. **Responsive design** - Test on mobile, tablet, desktop
2. **Confirmation dialogs** - What you see when sending transactions
3. **Language** - Does it make sense to non-crypto users?
4. **Customization opportunities** - Where would you add branding?

Testing instructions:
- Connect any wallet (MetaMask recommended for initial testing)
- Try "Send Money" (uses test amounts, safe to try)
- Try "Sign a Message"
- Note: Scroll to bottom for customization documentation

Looking for feedback on:
- Confusing language
- Mobile usability issues
- Customization suggestions
- Overall UX impressions

Thanks!
```

## Switching Between Demos

Currently set to: **UX Demo** ‚úÖ

To switch to technical test suite, edit `src/main.jsx`:

```javascript
const USE_UX_DEMO = false  // Changes to technical test suite
```

Then rebuild and redeploy:
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

---

## Mobile Device Testing

### Test URLs on Real Devices

1. **Get your Vercel URL** (after deploying)
2. **Open on phone/tablet** using:
   - QR code (generate at qr-code-generator.com)
   - Text/email the link to yourself
   - Vercel dashboard has a built-in QR code

### Chrome DevTools Responsive Testing

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click "Toggle device toolbar" (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + M)
3. Select device presets or enter custom dimensions
4. Test these viewports:
   - iPhone SE (375px)
   - iPhone 14 Pro (390px)
   - iPad (768px)
   - Desktop (1440px)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "cannot find module"
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
```

### Environment variables not working
- Make sure they start with `VITE_` prefix
- Redeploy after adding env vars (they're not applied until redeploy)
- Check Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Your deployment ‚Üí Environment Variables

### Mobile layout broken
- The UX demo uses responsive CSS Grid
- Should adapt automatically
- If issues persist, check browser console for errors

### Confirmation dialogs not showing
- Only shows when transactions/signatures are requested
- Unicorn wallet needs proper env vars set
- Try with MetaMask first to verify app works
